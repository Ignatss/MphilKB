This repository contains the supplementary code and data for the MPhil thesis - *"Genetic regulation of the Marchantia polymorpha meristem"* by K. Bonter.

The Python code used to remove overlaps from the TF binding predictions (figure 25) was written in collaboration with Janka Uryga and is available at [lubieowoce/overlappy](https://github.com/lubieowoce/overlappy/blob/ccc2e5a390bf0c57bb95c81a31b7a21dcfe0f2f8/clean.py).
